# PathTranslator

This gem will allow one to specify one or more root directories and then
translate paths relative to them. Also will provide utility functionality
such as checking that the final path actually winds up under the root, 
creating directories relative to the root, etc. These are things I find
myself doing quite a bit with the various Medusa applications, so it
seems useful to extract into a single gem.
